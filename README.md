# Systemic Failures

This modification is a rework based on the source code and concepts of the following mods:
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3045796581
- https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114087512

All credit for the original ideas, assets and implementations belongs to their author.

This project does not aim to replace or compete with the original mods.
Its purpose is to restructure and consolidate their mechanics with a focus on
performance, scalability and maintainability.

Both Lua and XML logic were reworked where necessary.
